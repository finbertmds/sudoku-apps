## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the monorepo
git clone https://github.com/FinbertMDS/sudoku-apps.git
cd sudoku-apps

# Use Node.js 26 (all apps and CI)
nvm install
nvm use

# Install Yarn Classic if needed
npm install --global yarn@1.22.22

# Install all dependencies from the repository root
yarn install --frozen-lockfile

# Run Sudoku Classic (Expo)
dev:classic

# Run Sudoku Killer (React Native CLI)
dev:killer
```

---

Node.js 26 is required by every workspace. All Android and iOS CI workflows read
`.nvmrc`. Use Yarn Classic 1.22.22 and keep `yarn.lock` when installing dependencies.
If Xcode still uses an older Node installation, regenerate each app’s ignored
`ios/.xcode.env.local` after `nvm use`:

```bash
node_path="$(node -p process.execPath)"
printf 'export NODE_BINARY="%s"\n' "$node_path" > apps/classic/ios/.xcode.env.local
printf 'export NODE_BINARY="%s"\n' "$node_path" > apps/killer/ios/.xcode.env.local
```
